# bootstrap

A collection of scripts and documentation to make bootstrapping new
workstations easier.

The `install` script installs and updates tools and applications. Use
`configure` to apply preferences. Anything that isn't automated yet is
documented below.

## GNOME Extensions

Install and enable the Pop Shell extension through
[firefox](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/), specifically for window tiling.

## Slack

Install [directly](https://slack.com/downloads/linux) from Slack. Automate this
when there is a public download URL.

## Firefox

Install [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/) and
[Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
add-ons.
